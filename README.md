# Weather-Dashboard
## Purpose
This is a weather dashboard, which uses APIs from Open Weather to pull the temperature, humidity, wind, and UV Index, as well as an icon for current weather conditions. Previous searches are saved and stored locally, allowing the user to pull up the data again by clicking on the button generated by each search. Up to ten previous searches are displayed on the screen at once, with the rest being stored locally. If a user is to search the same city twice, the list will move the button to the top of the previous search list.
